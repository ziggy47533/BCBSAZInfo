Server that trigger the file to SI5:
that IP is the bcaz-wl-pr08 server and claimserver10 does run there

Launch Code :
1520 outbound to Zelis - Redcard_producer_out
1531 Outbound to PCS  (FNScndUndrscr)
1878 Outbound to Zelis also Its for SoAZ

These should run at 9AM and 330PM.. if not need to run these code manually..
1540 - HRP
1878 - SofAZ

look in SI5 using 3A4D11 then click on find with today date....

1540 pull files to the 5 different folders from SI5....

In the future you can use this splunk query to see if there are more than one paymentid for pcsoutbound folder

Note: make sure to refresh the scheduler or close it then enable the run for the script (Redcard).

All – below are 5 locations where SI drops the EOP payment files to.
