Due to the performance of SI files are not routing to Foresight but are being deleted from
the STArchive before EPS is notified the files are missing.
I need the below files dates restored to 

Z:\SIProd\Archives\Restore\EXELA 837 File restore
All 0000SRCP, 0000SRCI and 0000SRCD


June thru November 2022.
If you are unable to restore to the above drive please try
I:\Prod Support\STALLED FILES\Exela Missing File Restore
