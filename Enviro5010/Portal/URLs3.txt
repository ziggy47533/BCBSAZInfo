[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:19 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
James did you guys do a buf restore?
last night?
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:19 AM]  Brewer, James:  
CHG0084807 
No we did not do a restore
there was a change that caused some issues with buf
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:20 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
there a ticket INC0240632
from Sean Newman
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:22 AM]  Brewer, James:  
Nope, we did not do this restpr, I see it unassigned.
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:23 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
it was created at 10PM
that was not part of the roll back?
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:25 AM]  Brewer, James:  
no, looks like they did something in error, roll back happened way after that. I can do the restore quickly.
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:25 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
i would hold off..
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:26 AM]  Brewer, James:  
Yea I see he created it after 10pm, that would kind of make since if it was in error, I'll shoot him an email.
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:26 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
ok, thanks
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:26 AM]  Brewer, James:  
Yea rollback didnt happen until almost 2am
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:30 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
questions
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:31 AM]  Brewer, James:  
yea whats up?
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:35 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
those url that you ttacking in splunk what is ? that Rob put in Yammer
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:36 AM]  Brewer, James:  
Those are Public Portal links hosed on the sitecore servers.
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:37 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
they want to make sure user can get those url's?
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:39 AM]  Brewer, James:  
They want to make sure the users arent getting errors even after validating their credintials correctly.
I tried to pin point the exact error but didn't quite get it, I'll definitley need some assistance from the pros
But if you read the change, they listed the BUG buy each of the links.
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:40 AM]  Brewer, James:  
SO I was trying to find a error for each link so we can monitor that directly.
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:40 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
the short term is not about credentials it get quote
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:41 AM]  Brewer, James:  
Yea, different issue for each link.
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:42 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
would it be easier to do them as separate then in all in one? 
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:43 AM]  Brewer, James:  
Yes I thought about that as well, 
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:43 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
have it in one dashboard
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:43 AM]  Brewer, James:  
However, Ill still need to try capturing the current errors they are receiving and thats what I need help with.
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:44 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:  
who is in charge of these url's
person name?
maybe we can get a dumby account
so we can actually see what it does
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:44 AM]  Brewer, James:  
Team Nexus, Carlos Cordoba..
 
[‎3/‎26/‎2020 6:44 AM]  Mitchell, Chris:
