Cool.  On mp-abs-a01, the job Jobs, Folders & Plans\Enrollment\Production\EnrollTransCreator\ETC-EnrollTransCreator\877_BEEF_Prod
The job kicks off based on a file drop
the job hangs periodically
I have been aborting the job and redropping the file
 
[‎4/‎9/‎2020 9:49 AM]  Sawyer, Dave:  
sometimes that works, sometimes I have to redrop multiple times before it suddntly works
I can't see any rhyme or reason to it
 



What I have been doing is just redropping the xls file and sometimes it takes multiple drops.
