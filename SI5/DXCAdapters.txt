
SI5 issue with some adapters

I see the five sessions, they are related to these:

NPI-AUTO_REPORT.CSV
BCBSAZEX-Clms-Inv_HP2AZ.txt
Prod-Claim-Inv-Ext-Comp_HP2AZ.cmp
PROD-CFR-DOC1CLM_EOB.txt
Local-COB-Daily_Report.CSV

I'm going to disable the adapter and see if that will for the sessions to close
- I don't see a way to just end them

these four, I do not see in file gateway:

NPI-AUTO_REPORT.CSV
BCBSAZEX-Clms-Inv_HP2AZ.txt
Prod-Claim-Inv-Ext-Comp_HP2AZ.cmp
Local-COB-Daily_Report.CSV


it's down to these three:

BCBSAZEX-Clms-Inv_HP2AZ.txt
Prod-Claim-Inv-Ext-Comp_HP2AZ.cmp
Local-COB-Daily_Report.CSV
