
Failure 455

For the reference, if a file has error FG_0455 “Arrived File is now failed while Routing with error message:
Could not extract consumer name using parameter ConsumerName from wfid…” (see screenshot below),
we can safely assume that SI does not have route setup and picked up extra file from partner SFTP or 
partner has dropped a file that we are not expecting. In these cases,
you can go ahead and check the review and disregard the failure.
