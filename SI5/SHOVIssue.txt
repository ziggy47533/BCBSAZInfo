
SHOV Issue

if you can remove the file and put it back in the folder to see if it will pick up. If that does not work you can open it in a text editor copy it into a new file and save it with the same file name and load it. I know makes no sense but it works.

pulling out those files and letting them sit outside of that drop folder until after the next run of the job
failed until pulled the files out and let the job run on its own without them, redropped them after that, and they took next time


if you see a space just remove the space and redripped them again.
