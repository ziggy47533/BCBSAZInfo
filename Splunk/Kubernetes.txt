“Kubernetes, or k8s, is an open source platform that automates Linux container operations.
... “In other words, you can cluster together groups of hosts running Linux containers,
and Kubernetes helps you easily and efficiently manage those clusters.”

    the issue is tied to a "liveness" check in the kubernetes pod, basically a failsafe type health check...
    it appears that healthcheck was taking too long to respond...
    the liveness check will fail the pod if it doesn't complete...
    at the request of the development team, I removed the liveness check...
    there's no real understanding as to why it was behaving that way...
