On VPCW10PD0206, 207, and 208 we have the below Jenkins processing schedule set up M-F.

1.	5:30am – a Metavance script that runs for 10-20 minutes.  The executable that runs is:
                C:\Production Support Automation\Executables\RunMVCorrespondenceLetterScript.vbs

2.	Immediately after script 1 completes – A Metavance script that processes claims found
on a daily spreadsheet.  The number of claims varies day to day, so it’s hard to predict
how long this process will run each day.

Executable: C:\Production Support Automation\Executables\RunEvicoreScript.vbs

3.	Immediately after script 2 completes – A Metavance script that processes claims
found on 10 different work lists.  The size of the work lists vary widely day to day.
This process can run for as little as 90 minutes to as much as 8 hours.

Executable: C:\Production Support Automation\Executables\Run MV Return Letters.vbs

4.	Immediately after script 3 completes – A Metavance script that processes claims found
on spreadsheets.  Some days there are no spreadsheets to process, so the script starts
and stops in less than a minute.  Some days there are large spreadsheets resulting
in the script to run all the way until midnight.

Executable: C:\Production Support Automation\Executables\Run BalanceDueReworkScript.vbs

5.	Immediately after script 4 completes – A script that just writes a line to a log file every 5 minutes.
This script quits running at 5:00pm.

Executable: C:\Production Support Automation\Executables\Run PingLogFileScript.vbs


All of the above scripts write to a log file at least once every 5 minutes.  The log file is:
                \\baz-filer02\common\EDS\Performance Manager Logs\QTP Logs\UFT0207\<yyyymmdd>.txt

I currently have an ActiveBatch script set up that monitors that log file from 7:00am – 5:00pm.  
The ActiveBatch script sends my team an email anytime that log file has not been updated for more than 15 minutes.

I have ActiveBatch scripts that check those log files every 15 minutes to make sure that the log files are getting updated regularly.  But I don't care about the content of the log entries.

The Active Batch scripts check the Last Modified time of the log file, but the Active Batch scripts don't check the actual content of the log files.
