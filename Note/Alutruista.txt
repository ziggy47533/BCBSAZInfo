Where are these files coming from?  I checked the folders but there empty for now..

do these files go somewhere once they land in the directories?

how long should these files be in the folder?

the files will sit there until, I think 3pm...
when the print shop picks them up...
the "Redcard" file... may be a quick flip to RedCard... would need to ask Andrea...
